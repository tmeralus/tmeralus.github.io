> Knowledge, like air, is vital to life. And like air, no one should be denied it.


In April of 2017 I was asked to showcase my skills in Linux at a workshop for a friend at Florida Atlantic University. With my love for linux and passionate posts about technology and the latest tech on Linkedin and Facebook Stincy thought I would be the right teacher for her ACM-W group. In lieu of us growing up together through grade school and her knowing that my mom was a teacher and was going to help me draft a quick lesson plan. Mom came in with the assist and within a week of the offer a lesson plan was created.

Being a part of something bigger than myself and exposing more people to the world of Linux is what
drives me to get out of bed in the morning.

With a helpful template from my mom I broke down my lesson plan in 3 weeks thinking that I would be able to slowly go over different commands to make sure everyone was aware of what they were doing
and how they were doing it.

* Session 1: Introduction to Linux
** commands and use of Linux
** navigating through a Linux server
* Session 2: Linux from a shell point of view
** Bash Scripting
** Understanding the Shell
* Session 3: Practical Networking
** Networking commands
** Monitoring Tools and solutions
* Session 4: Wrap
** Students use of Linux
** Wrap up assignments
** Github lab


I created powerpoints for each week and was alloted an hour and a half and had to revise my lesson plan every week. The students, being college kids interested in Linux were well prepared and bored towards the end of week 3. So with week 4 I decided to create an open forum for them to ask questions and see what kinds of things moved them. Many were interested in quirky terminal based works like neofetch![Neofetch](https://github.com/tmeralus/tedley.me/blob/master/assets/img/blog/neofetch.png)

After week 4 we took a finals picture and I left with a smile on my face. The new friends and the people involved helped push me to write more about educational Linux guides.

I spent the rest of 2017 writing up how to guides on how to setup and use Vagrant, Wordpress, Apache, and use other hacking tools to share to the world. I have always been one to use my google-fu tto find great guides on stackoverflow and reddit, but now Im the one giving advice and adding more how-to's to those sites. Don't get me wrong, I still use sites like Spiceworks and AskUbuntu to ask questions and learn more from Linux communities but being able to give back and contribute to the community is more than any dollar can spend. Feel free to follow me on Twitter to stay up to date with more tech news, my latest tech blogs, or Miami heat celebration. You can also follow my RSS feed soon to stay up to date with anything and everything Linux.
