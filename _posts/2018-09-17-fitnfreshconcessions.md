<center><a href="http://www.garciatruckfood.com/home-fnf/"><b> Fit n Fresh Concessions</b></a> was born out of a vision to bring delicious and healthier alternatives to traditional concession food to the streets.</center>


 I wanted to make it approachable and even “craveable” to the mainstream non-veggie eater (like I was), as well as die hard vegans, vegetarians, and health conscious eaters who attend events without the options they desire.

After wanting to improve on my own diet I was introduced to a whole new way of eating. I became more aware of the way in which food affects our lives, and the idea to make this concession trailer slowly began to emerge. If I could combine fun, delicious food with what is healthy I believed there would be a place in the concession food market for me.

The journey from the common fair food to sweet and savory healthy concession food has been an amazing and truly life changing experience and I hope everyone loves what I bring.

We are constantly growing and looking to include motivated passionate people to our events so if you are looking for a fun place to work give us a try!
