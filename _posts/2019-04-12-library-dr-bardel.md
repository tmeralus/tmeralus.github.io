Library Dr Bardel Belizaire is a non-profit organization that was opened to inspire people of all ages to read. Located in the tiny village of Moron (Grand-Anse) in Haiti, the library seeks to open a wealth of knowledge to people in that community who would not have access to books or technology. The donation of books and laptops has allowed the library to remain open for one year. YEAH! One year of reading and learning of technology.
