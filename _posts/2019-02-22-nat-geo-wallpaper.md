# NEW APP ALERT
![Nat-Geo App](/assets/img/blog/nat-geo.png)

Have you ever logged into your computer and felt overwhelmed with a sense of boredom
because your wallpaper is dull. Are you tired of looking at the same pictures that Ubuntu has
to offer and need just a lil more spice every time you log onto your computer. Well this app created
by [atareao](https://github.com/atareao) should brighten up your day.

The [National-Geographic-wallpaper App](https://github.com/atareao/national-geographic-wallpaper) is hands down
one of the best apps I have found in my year of linux due to its simplicity and ease of use.

Obviously from the name it will automatically change your wallpaper every day for you to National Geographic's
Photo of the day. I have this installed on my laptop, Office workstation, and Desktop at home with different setups for each. This app allow you to switch between National Geographic's Photo of the day, to Bing, GoPro, NASA, and Wallhavens photos as well. After a long day or a strong coffee in the early morning its always refreshing to start working or turn on your computer to see a new and interesting image on your computer screen. One less thing to be automated.
