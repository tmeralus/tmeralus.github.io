> Knowledge, like air, is vital to life. And like air, no one should be denied it.


Coming from a place of change and constant motion I use my words to slow
down and take note. As a brother and son to a family of smart-witted individuals
who enjoy taking their creativity and find outlets to release them. Mine is within
a pen and pad. **Tedley's Poetry Portal** is a way to keep a list of the poems, finished, unfinished, alive, and dead.

# Daily Dose
Many words catch peoples attention,
Poems can be recited at the sound of a mention,
Everyday I wake up and this poem teaches me a lesson,
I pray one day it does the same for you,
Read them as words,
or Read them as Blessings

# Winners Vs Losers

Winners vs Losers

The Winner is always part of the answer;
the Loser is always part of the problem.

The Winner always has a program;
the Loser always has an excuse.

The Winner says, “Let me do it for you”;
the Loser says, “That’s not my job.”

The Winner sees an answer for every problem;
the Loser sees a problem for every answer.

The Winner says, “It may be difficult but it is possible”; the
Loser says, “It may be possible but it is too difficult.”

When a Winner makes a mistake, he says, “I was wrong”;
when a Loser makes a mistake, he says, “It wasn’t my fault.”

A Winner makes commitments;
a Loser makes promises.

Winners have dreams;
losers have schemes.

Winners say, “I must do something”;
losers say, “Something must be done.”

Winners are a part of the team;
losers are apart from the team.

Winners see the gain;
losers see pain.

Winners see possibilities;
losers see problems.

Winners believe in win/win;
losers believe for them to win someone has to lose.

Winners see the potential;
losers see the past.

Winners are like a thermostat;
losers are like thermometers.

Winners choose what they say;
losers say what they choose.

Winners use hard arguments, but soft words;
losers use soft arguments, but hard words;

Winners stand firm on values but compromise on petty things;
losers stand firm on petty things but compromise on values.

Winners follow the philosophy of empathy:
“Don’t do to others what you don’t want them to do to you”;
losers follow the philosophy,
“Do it to others before they do it to you.”

Winners make it happen;
losers let it happen.
