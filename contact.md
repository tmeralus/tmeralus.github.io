# Ways to Contact Me

## [Twitter](https://wwwtwitter.com/exploi_TED) if you want to get in touch.

 I love meeting new people (especially in tech) so don't hesitate to send a message or as a question!
 My open source work started as a fun hobby, but as this blog got more popular, it has turned into a full-time job commitment without pay or benefits. I would really appreciate if you support my hard work, so that I'll be able to continue my passion and projects.

 My full-time job is a Linux/Systems Administrator, so feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss potential projects, questions about tech, or need any paid help.
