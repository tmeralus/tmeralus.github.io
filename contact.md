## Contact Me

 I love meeting new people (especially in tech) so don't hesitate to send a message or as a question!

 My full-time job is a Linux/Systems Administrator, so feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss potential projects, questions about tech, or need any paid help.

 ### [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/techgameteddy) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmeralus) are the best places to contact me if you want to get in touch.
