When working with variables in Ansible, sometimes you donâ€™t need the whole string, just a part of it.

For example, we have a variable like ansible_nodename containing the fqdn: server1.example.org and want to create a label with only the first part: server1

Ansible uses jinja2 for formatting so filters can be applied.

{{  ansible_nodename.split(".")[0] | lower }}
