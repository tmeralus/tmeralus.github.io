Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.[6] Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[7] Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.[8] 
Docker Inc. was founded by Kamel Founadi, Solomon Hykes, and Sebastien Pahl
