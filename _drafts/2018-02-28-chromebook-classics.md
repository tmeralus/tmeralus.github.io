In 2010 I found myself in college with the idea that I can get through school and leave debt free if I could find a way to find free alternatives to Microsoft or Closed Source Projects that you normally have to pay for. Before I purchased a new HP laptop the only mobile resource at the time was a Google Chromebook.
It was supposed to be the next big thing and the Windows 8 killer. Knowing that I had to be resourceful I decided to challenge myself and get all my work done on my chromebook.
The challenge lead to be these tools which I have added to my list as chromebook Classic Apps (or chromebook essential apps) to survive on a budget.

A few essential things needed for me to get by were

* Microsoft Office like suite
* Quick notes app
* Chart/Diagram Editor
* Programming editor or IDE
* Online Image Editing
* Online Caculator - https://www.desmos.com/scientific

## MS office online and Google Docs
For those of you who may not know Microsoft Office provides an online option for
Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and Excel, that are free to anyone with a microsoft based account. Those of you with a @hotmail.com email or an xbox live account can login to their [Live email](https://outlook.live.com/owa/), find the grid button at the top left of their screen (see image) and choose Word.

The screen shot above show that office online comes with Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and a list of other options. For those of you college kids who are comfortable with Microsoft office and don't want to switch, you can use the online options office provides to get papers and spreadsheets completed.

Some people don't want to go out of their way and create a hotmail account or a new email account....well, most schools these days use office365 for your school email which also provides these free tools, so this option may already be there for you without you knowing it.

Google has also google docs which allows cloud collaboration with word documents, PowerPoint slides, and projects. Every college project I've worked in had a google word document or spreadsheet included in it for each person to add and update their part of the project from their phone, tablet, or laptop wherever they are. I think this knowledge will not only save you money each year but will make working with teams together a breeze.
