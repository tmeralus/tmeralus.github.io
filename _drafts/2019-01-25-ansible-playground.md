Every sports champion has a ring or a jersey in the rafters that help show that their growth and accolades
in the game. Developers, young aspiring programmers, and Administrators don't have a hall of fame to showcase
their work but there are ways of showing your process. Your "how I got here", the "More than a resume" page that sticks out
and can showcase your work to the world. Here is how to get it done with Github and Godaddy.

Disclaimer: This may be a long read but if you follow these steps you'll finish reading this blog with a customer website to use on as a resume or as a simple blog to share with other developers.

## LETS GET STARTED
Steps to
-- create GitHub account
-- setup pages with free domain
--private repos and public repos (microsoft)
-- create cloudflare account
-- setup ssl
-- setup ssl on gitlab
-- download freelance repo
-- download blog repo
-- Atom IDE and github
-- jekyll and Markdown
-- push and commits
-- testing your site
-- update your twitter bio
-- send a shoutout to me
-- give me feedback

Before I get into it I want to express my frustrations when I find people online (more specifically Twitter) who have a domain
in their bio that link to nowhere. I get so excited to see young individuals like myself in the tech field and want to learn
more about what they know or what they are working on currently, just to find out that they didn't keep up with their site.
With this blog you'll be able to keep your site up and running, give or take you pay annually for your domain.


## Git and Github
For those newbies getting into programming or the tech field, the term version control and Github may be ready or said
in your journey. Lets define what Github is. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM). To simplify it, it is an online spot to post your code and projects to share and collaborate with others. Github, in my opinion is a mix between a "Dropbox" for your code and a small social hub for programmers. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. There are hundreds of open source projects that host their software on Github which allows you to view what new features were added and how they were added. This can be resourceful when you want to learn how a company builds and compiles their code. [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is another one of the popular source control platforms that provides a great amount of tools to help keep your projects organized and track errors.

## Github and Gitlab Pages
The best part of this blog is using and setting up [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/). Github Pages, is a [Jekyll driven](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator that is free to use to create plain text sites.
For those of you who have built sites only using HTML,CSS, and Javascript can rejoice because this will allow you to now use your knowledge and create your own site, and let these Pages do the heavy lifting and server hosting for you.

 Those who use php or python (flask, django, etc) wont be as excited. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.

## Cloudflare SSL setup
Security is important in the days of the Information Age where Data Breaches happen more than your Mom told you to clean your room back in the day (or yesterday for some of us :) ). Cloudflare is a Web Performance and Security company that provides a free CDN. A CDN is a Content Delivery Network which allows you to route and protect where your data is going and how its being secured. We will be using cloudflare to generate an ssl and set it up on your site so that your site will have a HTTPS in front of it and not an HTTP. In another blog post I went over web scraping and pentesting websites to gain information that further explains why you should be securing your websites.

## Finding the right theme
Some of you readers don't want to have to deal with the pains of building your own static theme and just want to find something simple to use so you can start blogging or showcase your talent, then you can look for themes here. [Jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/).

To create a resume or Freelance page you can download the  theme here.
