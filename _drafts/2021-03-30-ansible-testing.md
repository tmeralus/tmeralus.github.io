Its been well over a years since I started using ansible and learned about what it can do and what it can't. I wanted to share a few dev tricks I have learned over the years with using ansible to connect to machines, or test ansible playbooks. I also want to explain that the tests and things I plan on talking about are not standard practice for how to use ansible or how to connect to docker containers, however, they were things I learned as I went along and used for testing.

What is ansible
How is ansible commonly used
testing ansible playbooks
using test servers
home lab hustle

What I learned through testing with docker containers.
