> Knowledge, like air, is vital to life. And like air, no one should be denied it.


Coming from a place of change and constant motion I use my words to slow
down and take note. As a brother and son to a family of smart-witted individuals
who enjoy taking their creativity and find outlets to release them. Mine is within
a pen and pad. **Tedley's Poetry Portal** is a way to keep a list of the poems, finished, unfinished, alive, and dead.
