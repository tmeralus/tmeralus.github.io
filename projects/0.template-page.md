> Knowledge, like air, is vital to life. And like air, no one should be denied it.


In April of 2017 I was asked to showcase my skills in Linux at a workshop for a friend at Florida Atlantic University. With my love for linux and passionate posts about technology and the latest tech on Linkedin and Facebook Stincy thought I would be the right teacher for her ACM-W group. In lieu of us growing up together through grade school and her knowing that my mom was a teacher and was going to help me draft a quick lesson plan. Mom came in with the assist and within a week of the offer a lesson plan was created.

I created powerpoints for each week and was alloted an hour and a half and had to revise my lesson plan every week. The students, being college kids interested in Linux were well prepared and bored towards the end of week 3. So with week 4 I decided to create an open forum for them to ask questions and see what kinds of things moved them. Many were interested in quirky terminal based works like neofetch![Neofetch](https://github.com/tmeralus/tedley.me/blob/master/assets/img/blog/neofetch.png)
